#para is a sequence of space-separated words. 
# All words will be in lower case. 
# There will be a single space between consecutive words. 
# The string has no other special characters other than the space.
#Write a function named exact_count that accepts the string para and 
# a positive integer nn as arguments. You have to return True if 
# there is at least one word in para that occurs exactly nn times, and False otherwise.
#You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. 
# You just have to write the function definition.
